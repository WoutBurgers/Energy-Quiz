# Any other business
If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.

# Questions for the TA

 - Do questions need to be stored permanently or can we create them before each game?
 - How should we store the activities from activityBank?
 - Activities are formatted correctly so it isn't our problem right?

# Question round

Good luck this week all!
